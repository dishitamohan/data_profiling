* **Invalid Characters in ObligorName:** Review the ObligorName field and remove any special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*(){}[]\/|<>).  Ensure the name uses only alphanumeric characters, spaces, commas, periods, hyphens, and apostrophes.  Consult the institution's naming convention policy for specific guidance.

* **Invalid TIN (Tax Identification Number):** Verify the TIN against a reliable database (e.g., IRS TIN matching service).  If incorrect, obtain the correct TIN from the customer. If the entity is foreign, ensure the appropriate foreign tax identifier is used and formatted correctly.

* **Invalid Maturity Date Format:**  Correct the date format to match the system's required format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD). Ensure the date is accurate and logically consistent with other transaction details.

* **Unnecessary Facility Description:** If the facility description duplicates information already captured in other fields or provides unnecessary detail, remove or condense it. Retain only essential information for compliance and reporting purposes.

* **Unnecessary Purpose Description:**  Similar to the facility description, remove or condense the purpose description if it's redundant or overly verbose.  Maintain clarity and conciseness.

* **Unapproved Line of Business:**  Determine why the transaction was flagged for an unapproved line of business. If the line of business is genuinely unauthorized, the transaction may need to be rejected.  If it's a coding error, correct the line of business code to reflect the appropriate authorized activity. This may require escalating to a manager or compliance officer.

* **Invalid Reserve Amount:** Verify the calculation methodology for the reserve amount and ensure it aligns with internal policies and regulatory requirements.  Correct any calculation errors or adjust the reserve amount as needed, documenting the justification for any adjustments.

* **CustomerID Filtered:** Investigate why the CustomerID is being filtered. This could be due to sanctions screening, KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) alerts, or internal watchlists.  Conduct enhanced due diligence on the customer and consult with the compliance department to determine the appropriate course of action. The transaction may need to be blocked or reported depending on the nature of the filter hit.


**Compliance Steps (Overall):**

* **Document all remediation actions:** Maintain a clear audit trail of all corrections and adjustments made to the transaction data.
* **Escalate complex issues:**  If any of the flagged issues require further investigation or involve potential compliance violations, escalate to the appropriate compliance officer or legal counsel.
* **Review internal policies:** Ensure that the transaction and its remediation comply with all relevant internal policies and procedures.
* **Periodically review flagged transactions:** Conduct regular reviews of flagged transactions to identify patterns and improve internal controls.


By systematically addressing each flagged issue and following the compliance steps, you can mitigate risks and ensure the transaction adheres to regulatory and internal requirements.
